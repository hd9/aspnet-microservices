Featuring a variety of awe-inspiring locales (some grotesque, some majestic), the same finely-tuned combat fans had come to expect, and a new emphasis on speed and versatility inspired by FromSoftware's own Bloodborne, Dark Souls 3 is a wonderful encapsulation of the series as a whole; not as scattered as Dark Souls 2, not as rough around the edges as the original. If you've been curious about the Souls games, this is where you should start.",
